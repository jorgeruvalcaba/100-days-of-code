# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on integrate the backend with a bulk request to display locked badges.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't as easy as I thought. Will need to ask for help to get the badge link in an easier way.

### Day 2: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on special project displaying some badges. Playing some time with jsx and fetching data from typescript service.
