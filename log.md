# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on integrate the backend with a bulk request to display locked badges.

**Thoughts:** It wasn't as easy as I thought. Will need to ask for help to get the badge link in an easier way.

### Day 3: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I dedicated this time to investigation of some web optimizations using ImageMagick for images. It's really interesting match all the results.

**Thoughts:** I need to finish the tech plan tomorrow, also I need to focus on getting the setup for the med app and some tasks for the backlog.

### Day 4: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I started building the base for the medico app, the new app for medical notes. I chose Next.js so I can learn how to use it and one of its advantages is that it support server side rendering which I could need at some point in this project.

**Thoughts:** I need to learn about good practices when setting new projects so I can define a good structure in the project and allow scalability if needed.
